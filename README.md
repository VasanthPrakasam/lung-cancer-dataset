# Lung Cancer Dataset
This dataset provides a structured foundation for developing cancer detection models. It consists of various features related to patient demographics, lifestyle habits, medical history, and symptoms associated with pulmonary disease, aiming to predict the presence of lung cancer.
---
### Column Description:
The dataset includes diverse symptoms essential for comprehensive analysis and model development. Key categories and their respective features are:
1.  **Patient Demographics:**
    * **AGE:** The age of the patient.
    * **GENDER:** The gender of the patient (Male/Female).
2.  **Symptoms and Lifestyle Factors:**
    * **SMOKING:** Indicates smoking status.
    * **YELLOW_FINGERS:** Presence of yellow fingers.
    * **ANXIETY:** Presence of anxiety.
    * **PEER_PRESSURE:** Influence of peer pressure.
    * **CHRONIC_DISEASE:** Presence of chronic disease.
    * **FATIGUE:** Level of fatigue.
    * **ALLERGY:** Presence of allergies.
    * **WHEEZING:** Presence of wheezing.
    * **ALCOHOL_CONSUMING:** Alcohol consumption habits.
    * **COUGHING:** Presence of coughing.
    * **SHORTNESS_OF_BREATH:** Experience of shortness of breath.
    * **SWALLOWING_DIFFICULTY:** Difficulty in swallowing.
    * **CHEST_PAIN:** Presence of chest pain.

### Objective:
The main objective of this dataset is to serve as an invaluable asset for the development of cancer detection models, contributing to the global effort in understanding and combating lung cancer.
---
### Machine Learning Approach:
The dataset is best suited for supervised learning tasks, specifically classification. The target variable would be the presence or absence of lung cancer, which is a categorical outcome, making it ideal for predictive modeling to determine a person's risk of having lung cancer based on the provided features.

### Conclusion:
This dataset is designed for supervised learning, particularly for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the likelihood of an individual having lung cancer based on their symptoms and demographic information.
